This is an AI project using both the Random Forest Classifer and the Suport Vector Machine (SVM)

The dataset used in this project is the "Fuel Economy" Dataset, which contains information about car models and their fuel efficiency. 

It is sourced from Kaggle and consists of 3,930 rows of data. 

The dataset aims to classify cars into three different fuel efficiency categories: low, medium, and high, based on various specifications.
 
It includes information on fuel efficiency in city and highway driving, along with other attributes such as engine size, drivetrain, fuel type, and emissions,
which can be used to evaluate and categorize cars based on their fuel economy performance.
